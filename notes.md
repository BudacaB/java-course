The main difference between heap and stack is that stack memory is used to store local variables and function call while heap memory is used to store objects in Java.

Expressions are a combination of variables, literals and operators

5 - x

5 -> literal

' - ' -> operator

x -> variable

In Java add a ';' semicolon at the end of the line and you get a statement

' = ' -> assignment operator

! Left operand must be a variable in Java (x = 5)

! Evaluation is done right to left

! If you need a float division, make sure at least one of the operands is defined as a float
